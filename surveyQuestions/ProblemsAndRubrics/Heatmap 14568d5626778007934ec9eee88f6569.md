      "Question": "If aisle C's temperature increased to match aisle A, how might this change the overall temperature distribution in the storage area and what items may no longer be suitable in aisle C?",
      "Answer": [
        "The storage area would have more high-temperature sections overall.",
        "Items requiring cooler conditions, such as dairy and frozen goods, may no longer be suitable in aisle C."

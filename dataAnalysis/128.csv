Study Title: Enhancing Visualization Literacy through Analogical Explanations: Bridging Abstract Data Concepts with Intuitive Understanding

Supported By: University of Toronto

 

WHAT IS THIS FORM?

This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participation in this research. We encourage you to take some time to think this over and ask questions now and at any other time. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will be given a copy for your records.
 

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY THAT I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?


	
	You can choose not to take part.
	
	
	You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
	
	
	Your decision will not be held against you.
	

 

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

We aim to explore how analogies inspired by real-world objects can help people, especially those new to data interpretation, better understand and interpret novel chart types.
 

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

Any person who is at least 18 years of age may participate in this research study.
 

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?

We expect about 200 people will be in this research study.
 

WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE?

 
This research study consists of two phases. In each phase, you will be presented with a chart that represents the same data but in a different format. After reviewing each chart, you will answer questions to assess your understanding of the information presented. The study is expected to take approximately 40–50 minutes to complete.  

 
WILL BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY HELP ME IN ANY WAY? 

You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. The potential benefits to you from participation may include learning about how data visualization research is conducted, and you may learn about issues of current interest in data visualization.
 

WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? 

Your participation in this study does not involve any risks other than what you would encounter in daily life. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a keyboard. You may withdraw at any time.
 

HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE PROTECTED? 

Efforts will be made to ensure the privacy and security of your personal information throughout the study. The Prolific platform is designed with thorough safeguards to protect participant data, and your information will be handled in accordance with their stringent privacy standards. 
Data Sharing: De-identified data from this study may be shared among research teams at the University of Toronto. Only individuals who require access for research purposes, such as members of the research team will review your study-related records. 


 

ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION 

For this research study, we may also require participants to engage in activities beyond just answering questions. This may include: 

 

A) Sketching or Drawing: We may ask you to create sketches or drawings as part of the data analysis process. This will be done strictly for research purposes and you do not need any specific drawing skills to participate. All your sketches or drawings will remain confidential and used only for this study. 

 

B) Audio Recording: Throughout your participation, you may also be asked to have your voice recorded. This audio recording will be used for transcription and analysis for the study. The recordings will be securely stored and only accessible to the research team. We will not collect any identifiable information from these recordings. 

 

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?

If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Carolina Nobre, at cnobre@cs.toronto.edu. 

For questions about your rights as a research participant, you may contact the Human Research Ethics Unit at ethics.review@utoronto.ca or 416-946-3273.

 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY YES, BUT I CHANGE MY MIND LATER?

You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, simply exit the experiment.  Any data already collected will not be saved.

 

By clicking “I consent” below you are indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read this consent form, and agree to participate in this research study with these additional collection methods. However, as with all aspects of this study, participation is entirely voluntary and you may opt out of these particular activities if you choose to. Please print a copy of this page for your records.",What is your level of familiarity with the following chart type?,What is your age?,What is your gender?,What is your highest level of education?,What field is your degree in or what profession are you in?,"Choose the answer which best explains your preference and click the box next to it. Please click more than one if a single answer does not match your perception. Leave blank any question that does not apply.

The horizontal axis represents soil depth in centimeters, while the vertical sections depict different years. The colored bars within each year indicate the thickness of each soil layer.

This visually demonstrates the loss of valuable topsoil, which is crucial for plant growth and overall soil health.
Emphasis on Organic Matter Decline: The reduction in the organic layer further reinforces the message. Organic matter is essential for soil fertility, water retention, and overall soil structure. Its decline indicates a loss of vital soil functions.
Call to Action: By showcasing these changes, the author likely aims to raise awareness about the consequences of soil degradation and encourage action to protect and restore soil health.

The chart is represnted by different size dots (small to large). We see a trend where it seems as though we have more smaller dots on the lower end of  the chart (they are skewed towards the left which has lower numeric values) and we have the dots becoming larger as they reach higher values (skewed towards the right, represented by high numeric values). We see the chat is showing an upward slope, going from lower values (left side) to higher values, right side.  The dots seem to get large for example when we have vertical declination value 70 and right ascension value 80 as show on the graph.

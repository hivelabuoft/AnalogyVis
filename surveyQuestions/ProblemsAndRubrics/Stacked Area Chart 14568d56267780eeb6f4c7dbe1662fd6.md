      "Question": [
        "What do you think this chart is about? Can you describe what each color or section represents?",
        "What overall trend do you notice in the soil layers over time in this chart?"
      ],
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "No response or answer completely off-target. The student does not attempt to identify any layers or trends.",
        "1": "Vague or minimal response. The student might mention the chart is about soil layers but identifies only one or two layers vaguely, with little or no mention of trends. For example, saying 'It shows soil' without detailing layer names or time-based changes.",
        "2": "Basic understanding. The student identifies at least two correct soil layers (e.g., Topsoil and Bedrock) but omits several key layers and provides a very general or incomplete description of trends over time.",
        "3": "Moderate response. The student correctly identifies the main theme and at least three layers, and mentions a trend (e.g., increase or decrease in thickness) but lacks detail on specific observations or the complete list of layers. Some key details (like erosion or specific layer roles) are missing.",
        "4": "Good response. The student provides a comprehensive description of most main layers (ideally naming Organic, Topsoil, Eluviation, Subsoil, Parent Rock, Bedrock) and a general explanation of the overall trend. Minor details or nuances (such as exact timing or secondary observations) may be omitted.",
        "5": "Excellent response. The student offers a thorough explanation that includes all the key layers with their correct names and colors, and provides specific observations regarding the trend over time (e.g., noting specific periods of increase or decrease, and potential implications like soil development or erosion)."
      }
    },
    {
      "Category": "Identification",
      "Question": "Identify the color and position of the 'Topsoil' layer in the chart.",
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "Incorrect identification. The student fails to correctly state either the color or the correct position of the Topsoil layer.",
        "5": "Correct identification. The student clearly states that Topsoil is the second layer from the top and is represented by a brown color. No ambiguity remains."
      }
    },
    {
      "Category": "Simple Calculation (Visually)",
      "Question": "Visually estimate the thickness of the 'Topsoil' layer in 1994.",
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "Poor estimation. The student's answer is far off from the expected value, showing a lack of understanding or misinterpretation of the visual data.",
        "5": "Reasonable estimation. The student's estimation (approximately 20 units) is close to the correct value and reflects an accurate interpretation of the visual information."
      }
    },
    {
      "Category": "Analysis",
      "Question": "Analyze the trend on how the thickness of the Organic Layer changes from 1974 to 2024.",
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "No analysis provided or completely irrelevant response.",
        "1": "Incorrect or unclear analysis. The student may attempt to describe the trend but gets the direction or details wrong.",
        "2": "Basic attempt. The student identifies a trend (either increase or decrease) but does not explain the changes over the full period or omits significant parts of the timeline.",
        "3": "Partial analysis. The student covers either the increase or decrease in thickness, but not both, or omits nuances in the trend over different periods (e.g., changes around 2004).",
        "4": "Good analysis. The student accurately identifies most key changes over time and provides reasons for the changes, though may miss minor fluctuations or detailed observations.",
        "5": "Detailed analysis. The student provides a thorough breakdown of the trend, noting that the Organic Layer increases slightly until around 2004 and then decreases towards 2024, with clear explanations and observations about the timing and magnitude of these changes."
      }
    },
    {
      "Category": "Comparison",
      "Question": "Compare the changes in thickness of the Eluviation layer and the Subsoil layer between 1974 and 2024. Indicate which years each layer is thicker, and identify any fluctuations or trends in their changes over time.",
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "No comparison or completely incorrect comparison between the two layers.",
        "1": "Incorrect or unclear comparison. The student might mix up the layers or provide irrelevant details without addressing the specified years or trends.",
        "2": "Minimal attempt. The student mentions one layer correctly but fails to compare both layers adequately or omits important time periods.",
        "3": "Partial comparison. The student describes trends for one layer correctly (e.g., noting that the Subsoil peaks around 2004) but provides limited or incomplete details about the Eluviation layer.",
        "4": "Mostly accurate comparison. The student correctly identifies the general trends (such as Eluviation being thicker from 2014 to 2024 and Subsoil peaking in 2004) but may miss some fluctuations or precise year-by-year observations.",
        "5": "Thorough comparison. The student accurately and comprehensively compares both layers, clearly indicating the periods when each layer is thicker, and noting fluctuations and trends (such as Eluviation being stable and thicker after 2014, and Subsoil decreasing gradually after its peak in 2004) with detailed observations."
      }
    },
    {
      "Category": "Prediction",
      "Question": "Based on the trends, predict how the thickness of the Eluviation layer might change after 2024.",
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "No prediction provided or prediction is completely irrelevant to the trends.",
        "1": "Poor or illogical prediction. The student's prediction does not align with the observed trends or lacks any rationale.",
        "2": "Minimal prediction. The student offers a prediction with little or no justification, showing only a basic attempt to connect past trends to future changes.",
        "3": "Reasonable prediction but lacks detail. The student predicts a change (e.g., a decrease) but provides limited explanation or supporting evidence.",
        "4": "Good prediction. The student gives a logical forecast (such as a continued decrease) with some justification based on observed trends, though minor details or potential alternative outcomes may be omitted.",
        "5": "Well-reasoned prediction. The student provides a thorough and logical forecast, clearly explaining that the thickness of the Eluviation layer may continue to decrease post-2024, and supports this prediction with specific observations from the chart's trends."

    {
      "Category": "Real-world Application",
      "Question": "How might changes in these soil layers impact agricultural practices?",
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "No response or answer completely off-topic.",
        "1": "Very weak application. The student mentions only one factor with little to no explanation, or provides an incorrect link to agricultural practices.",
        "2": "Basic application. The student identifies a single impact (such as nutrient availability) but fails to explain how the change affects agriculture.",
        "3": "Partial analysis. The student includes one or two relevant points (e.g., nutrient availability and drainage) but the explanation lacks depth or omits additional impacts.",
        "4": "Good analysis. The student covers multiple aspects (such as impacts on nutrient availability, drainage, and root support) with reasonable explanations, though some points could be further detailed.",
        "5": "Comprehensive impact analysis. The student thoroughly explains multiple impacts of the soil layer changes on agriculture, discussing aspects like nutrient availability, drainage, root support, and potential long-term effects on crop yield, with detailed and clear reasoning."

      "Category": "Recreation Sketch",
      "Question": "Sketch how the chart would look if the Topsoil layer increased by 10 cm in thickness by 2024. Please illustrate your understanding by drawing directly on the provided plot, clearly indicating any affected changes.",
      "Detailed Rubric": {
        "0": "No sketch provided or sketch is completely incorrect, failing to reflect any change.",
        "1": "Sketch is provided but does not correctly reflect the increase; the student might show a change in thickness that is not proportional or misplace the Topsoil layer.",
        "2": "Minimal sketch. The drawing shows some attempt to increase the Topsoil layer, but critical elements (such as correct re-distribution of the layers) are missing or inaccurate.",
        "3": "Partial sketch. The drawing shows an increased Topsoil layer, yet there are inaccuracies in how the other layers are adjusted or the overall proportions are not well maintained.",
        "4": "Good sketch. The drawing mostly reflects the Topsoil layerâ€™s increased thickness with proper adjustment of the other layers, though minor proportional errors or details might be overlooked.",
        "5": "Excellent sketch. The student accurately and clearly depicts the Topsoil layer increased by 10 cm, with all affected layers properly shifted downward and proportions maintained, demonstrating a strong understanding of the chart's structure."
